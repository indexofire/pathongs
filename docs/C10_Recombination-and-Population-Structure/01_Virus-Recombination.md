# Virus Recombination Analysis

### RDP4


### Simplot






## Programs
RDP
http://darwin.uvigo.es/rdp/rdp.html
Pros: Alread a compilation of detection algorithms for verification of analysis. Free and easy to install.
Cons: I can only get Manual methods to work on my Windows 7 machine specifically Bootscan, MaxChi, and 3Seq. Also poor interface.

SimPlot
http://sray.med.som.jhmi.edu/SCRoftw...ot/#disclaimer
Pros:Simple interface easy to use and visualize data. Implements algorithms Simplot, Bootscan, and FindSites.
Cons: Simplot More useful for evolutionarily closely related regions. Manual grouping of sequences in for analysis needs to be fixed. Can't seem to change window size or step size in Bootscan algorithm.

Algorithms
Bootscan
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15665649
Pros: Works well with divergent sequences, very visual representation. Not only shows possible recombination but also can show you divergent regions in a proteins primary structure.
Cons: Not really sure how to best optimize parameters. Specifically for the more divergent sequences.

MaxChi
http://pubmlst.org/software/analysis...red_test.shtml
Pros: Easy to understand and optimize, visual representation
Cons: Seems like there is a higher false psotive rate when working with more divergent sequences

3Seq
http://bima.ws/3seq/
Pros: Looks specifically at parental and recombinant sequences
Cons: Basically have no idea how this program works or what I should be looking for.

Simplot
http://sray.med.som.jhmi.edu/SCRoftw...lot/#geography
Pros:Visual representation
Cons: Only works with highly similar sequences.

bratNextgen
http://www.helsinki.fi/bsg/software/BRAT-NextGen/
pros: highly cited, for microorganism
cons: need to instrall MCR first, encountered a problem, I've been fixing it... not successful yes..
